    "# I. Course Overview\n",
    "## 1. Intro to A/B Testing\n",
    "A/B testing is a general methodology used online when people want to test out a **new product or a feature**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A/B tests allow people to determine **scientifically** how to optimize a website or a mobile app by trying out possible changes and seeing what performs better with users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using A/B tests means that people can get **data** to make decisions rather than relying on intuition or hispsters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal** in A/B testing is to design an experiment, that's going to be **robust** and give people **repeatable** results, so that people can actually make a good decision about whether or not to actually launch that product or feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full process of an A/B testing:\n",
    "- Choose a metric\n",
    "- Review statistics\n",
    "- Design experiments\n",
    "- Analyze results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Examples of A/B Testing in Industries\n",
    "- Google tested 41 different shades of blue.\n",
    "- Amazon initially decided to launch their first personalized product recommendations based on an A/B test showing a huge revenue increase by adding that feature. \n",
    "- LinkedIn tested whether to use the top slot on a user's stream for top news articles or an encouragement to add more contacts. \n",
    "- Amazon determined that every 100ms increase in page load time decreased sales by 1%. \n",
    "- Google’s latency results showed a similar impact for a 100ms delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kayak tested whether notifying users that their payment was encrypted would make users more or less likely to complete the payment.\n",
    "- Khan Academy tests changes like letting students know how many other students are working on the exercise with them, or making it easier for students to fast-forward past skills they already have. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What you can and can't do with A/B Tests\n",
    "#### When can you use A/B Testing\n",
    "- Add premium service\n",
    "- Move recommendation site: new ranking algorithm\n",
    "- Change backend-page load time, results users see, etc.\n",
    "- Test layout of initial page\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Not suitable: \n",
    "- online shopping company: is my site complete? \n",
    "- Website selling cars: will a change increase repeat customers or referrals?\n",
    "- update brand, including main logo\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Other Techniques Apart from A/B Testing\n",
    "- user experience research (eg., check user logs)\n",
    "- focus groups\n",
    "- surveys\n",
    "- human evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. A/B Testing Business Case - Audacity \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Background:\n",
    "Audacity is a website that creates online finance courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its user flow (also known as **customer funnel**) looks like this: \n",
    "- Homepage visits\n",
    "- Exploring the site\n",
    "- Create account\n",
    "- Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Change we want to make:\n",
    "Change the 'Start Now' button from orange to pink\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Experiment:\n",
    "**Initial Hypothesis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the \"Start Now\" button from orange to pink will increase how many students explore Audacity courses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose a metric:\n",
    "Refining the hypothesis to see which metric to use\n",
    "- total number of courses completed (not practical)\n",
    "- number of clicks on the \"Start Now\" button (not considering the number of page views)\n",
    "- fraction of clicks: number of clicks/ number of page views; this number is also called **click-through-rate**, or CTR\n",
    "- **click-through-probability**: number of unique visitors who click/ number of unique visitors to page\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **click-through-probability** as our metric\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Updated hypothesis:\n",
    "Changing the \"Start Now\" button from orange to pink will increase the **click-through-probability** of the website\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why click-through-probability over click-through-rate?\n",
    "Generally speaking, we use a rate when we want to measure the *usability* of the site, and a probability when we want to measure the *total impact*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here in the example, we are interested in whether users are *progressing* to the second level of the funnel, so we picked a probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to compute the rate/ probabaility?\n",
    "**To compute the rate**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, work with the engineers to modify the website. Engineers need to change the website so that on every page view, the event can be captured. And then whenever a user clicks, we can also capture the click event. \n",
    "- Second, after we captured the data, we sum the page views and the clicks, and then we divide to get the rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To compute the probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "count at most 1 child click per page view\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Repeating the Experiement\n",
    "Repeated measurement of click-through-probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**,\n",
    "visitors = 1000, unique clicks = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "--> click-through-probability = 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the experiment --> which results would *surprise* us if we repeated the experiment? \n",
    "A. 100\n",
    "\n",
    "B. 103\n",
    "\n",
    "C. 98\n",
    "\n",
    "D. 150\n",
    "\n",
    "E. 900\n",
    "\n",
    "**The answer is D & E.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we use when we decide if the number surprises us?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Review the statistics\n",
    "- binomial distribution\n",
    "- confidence intervals\n",
    "- hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we know how variable the estimate is likely to be?\n",
    "**binomial**: two exclusive outcomes\n",
    "\n",

    "eg. biased coin: p = 3/4\n",
